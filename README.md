# Assignment 5

## Overview
This project consists of a machine learning model development, aimed at demonstrating advanced techniques in deep learning using PyTorch. The `model.py` file defines the neural network architecture, `utils.py` contains utility functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and `S5.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that illustrates the model's training and testing process.

## Installation

To set up your environment to run these scripts, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- torch
- torchvision
- tqdm

You can install these packages using pip:

## Model.py

The `model.py` file in  project is a Python script dedicated to defining the neural network architecture for a specified machine learning task. 
It typically includes the import of necessary PyTorch modules. 
The script outlines the structure of the neural network, detailing the layers (e.g., convolutional layers, fully connected layers), activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), and any regularization mechanisms (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) to improve model training and generalization. 
This file is crucial for setting up the model that will be trained, validated, and tested with your dataset. 
It serves as a blueprint from which the model learns to make predictions or classifications based on input data.

- import torch  ## PyTorch library for deep learning
- import torch.nn as nn  # Module to create neural network layers
- import torch.nn.functional as F  # Functional interface containing typical operations used for building neural networks like activation functions
- import torch.optim as optim  # Optimizers for training neural networks
- from torchsummary import summary
- from torchvision import datasets, transforms  # Datasets and transformations utilities from torchvision

## Utils.py
The`utils.py` file is an integral component of machine learning projects, designed to streamline the preprocessing, training, and evaluation phases. 
It typically includes custom functions for data loading, which might involve augmenting or normalizing datasets to ensure the model receives well-prepared input.
Additionally, it often houses training loops, where the model's parameters are updated based on loss calculation and backpropagation, and validation routines to monitor the model's performance on unseen data. 
The file might also contain utility functions for saving and loading model checkpoints, logging training progress, and evaluating the model using various metrics to quantify its accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant performance indicators. 
This script not only enhances code reusability and readability but also supports scalable and efficient experimentation.

## S5.ipynb
Given the structure of typical Jupyter notebooks in machine learning projects, the S5.ipynb notebook likely serves as an interactive environment where the neural network model is trained and evaluated. 
It probably contains detailed, step-by-step code cells for data preprocessing, visualization of data and model performance metrics, execution of the training process using the model.py and functions from utils.py, and evaluation against a test dataset. 
Notebooks like this often include markdown cells with extensive documentation explaining the rationale behind each step, experimental results, and conclusions, providing a comprehensive overview of the machine learning workflow.
