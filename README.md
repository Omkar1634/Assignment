# Assignment 

## Overview
This project consists of a machine learning model development, aimed at demonstrating advanced techniques in deep learning using PyTorch. The `model.py` file defines the neural network architecture, `utils.py` contains utility functions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, and `S5.ipynb` is a Jupyter notebook that illustrates the model's training and testing process.

## Installation

To set up your environment to run these scripts, you will need Python 3.x and the following packages:

- torch
- torchvision
- tqdm

You can install these packages using pip:

## Model.py

The `model.py` file in a project is a Python script that defines the neural network architecture for a specific machine learning task. 
This file typically imports the necessary PyTorch modules and outlines the structure of the neural network, including the layers (e.g., convolutional layers, fully connected layers), activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), and any regularization mechanisms (e.g., dropout, batch normalization) to improve model training and generalization.
This file is crucial for setting up the model that will be trained, validated, and tested with your dataset. 
It serves as a blueprint from which the model learns to make predictions or classifications based on input data.

- import torch  - **PyTorch library for deep learning**
- import torch.nn as nn -  **Module to create neural network layers**
- import torch.nn.functional as F -  **Functional interface containing typical operations used for building neural networks like activation functions**
- import torch.optim as optim  - **Optimizers for training neural networks**

## Utils.py
The`utils.py` file is an integral component of machine learning projects, designed to streamline the preprocessing, training, and evaluation phases. 
It typically includes custom functions for data loading, which might involve augmenting or normalizing datasets to ensure the model receives well-prepared input.
Additionally, it often houses training loops, where the model's parameters are updated based on loss calculation and backpropagation, and validation routines to monitor the model's performance on unseen data. 
The file might also contain utility functions for saving and loading model checkpoints, logging training progress, and evaluating the model using various metrics to quantify its accuracy, precision, recall, or other relevant performance indicators. 
This script not only enhances code reusability and readability but also supports scalable and efficient experimentation.

## S5.ipynb
Typically, in deep learning projects, Jupyter notebooks follow a structure where the S5.ipynb notebook acts as an interactive environment for training and evaluating the neural network model. This notebook usually contains detailed code cells for data preprocessing, performance metrics visualization, execution of the training process using `model.py` and `utils.py` functions, and evaluation against a test dataset. These notebooks also include markdown cells with extensive documentation that explain the rationale behind each step, experimental results, and conclusions. This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the deep learning workflow.
